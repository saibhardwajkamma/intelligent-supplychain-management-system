# Warehouse - Intelligent Supply Chain Management System

Warehouse is an innovative supply chain management system developed during a hackathon. It leverages blockchain technology for decentralized payments and incorporates predictive analytics for intelligent inventory management.

## Features

- **Supplier Marketplace**: Suppliers can list their products in a dedicated marketplace.
- **Employee Purchase Portal**: Employees can browse and purchase products from the marketplace.
- **Decentralized Payments**: Transactions are processed using blockchain technology, converting dollar amounts to equivalent ETH.
- **Warehouse Inventory Management**: Employees can add purchased products to the warehouse inventory.
- **Sales Prediction**: The system provides sales forecasts for products in the warehouse.
- **Demand-based Purchasing**: Employees can make informed decisions on future purchases based on predicted demand.

## How It Works

1. **Supplier Listings**: Suppliers add their products to the marketplace.
2. **Employee Purchases**: Employees browse the marketplace and purchase needed products.
3. **Payment Processing**: The system converts the purchase amount to ETH and transfers it to the supplier.
4. **Inventory Update**: Purchased products are added to the warehouse inventory.
5. **Sales Prediction**: The system analyzes historical data to predict future sales for each product.
6. **Demand Forecasting**: Based on predictions, the system suggests products that may need restocking.
7. **Replenishment**: Employees can easily purchase predicted high-demand items if they're available in the marketplace.
